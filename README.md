# ASAP
### A Simple Alternative Path

Rapidly traverse through a non-linear form with this nifty markov-chain based tool.
Use CTRL + SPACE to navigate to the next predicted field OR begin typing and use the dropdown list of possibilities and press enter to go to that respective field.

## Future Features:
- A count up timer to show you how quickly you can fill out the form using ASAP
  - Race your friends as they attempt with to fill out the form with the totally out of date mouse click and you use the totally cool ASAP tool

## BUGS TO FIX:
- When navigating with CTRL + SPACE, rendered dropdown list of previous element does not close
- Country input box has trouble rendering dropdown list properly and has a gap between it and the parent element
- Why did I leave in that 'Change Content' button?
